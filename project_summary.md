## Description
One of mankind's desire is to to take flight like birds. Birds are also a inspiration for aircrafts and wingsuites. What if you have a chance to be a part of a beatuiful display of birds?

"Emotions in Motion" attempts to express emotions with motions of birds, both as individuals and groups. The project explore our relationship with emotions, colours and sounds. And also the place of our emotions in the world of emotions.

## Details
A user would first interact with a tablet display which showcases a jailed bird (literally). The user would be able to pick a color representing the bird, and bird interacts with touches form the user. However, the bird seemingly locked in a virtual bird cage invokes a feeling of loneliness. To free the bird from its lonely misery, the user swipe the device in a guesture for the bird to fly out of the the jail into the Canvas screen to find its flock birds.

Upon releasing, the bird taking on the user's chosen color spawns into 64 birds with slight variation of its color. Birds of the same feathers (in this case, similiar colors) would then tend to interact more with each other. The camera follows this flock of bird for 4 minutes until it disappears into the void.
