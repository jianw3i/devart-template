#4. Audio Exploration

_“In order to see birds it is necessary to become a part of the silence.” ― Robert Lynd_

These were some brain stormed ideas for the audio explorations for this part of the project.

### Bird Sounds and Emotions

With emotions, motion and birds being at the forefront of this experiment, what kind of sounds can we work with?

1. Purely synthetic, ambient sounds. The idea here would be to make the sonic environment as a counterpoint to the natural feeling of the visuals. The dynamism of that against a realistic looking flock of birds, made of semi-realistic 3D objects would be an interesting exploration

2. Bird sounds? This was an interesting challenge. We found a great resource for making bird sounds, [Start from Birdcall synthesis - Obiwannab](http://obiwannabe.co.uk/tutorials/html/tutorial_birds.html). Can we synthesize bird sounds using Web Technologies (which was the target platform)?


### Interaction and Emotion

1. Data sonification. Using emotions 'left' by previous users to create ambience. The [project to sonify Github commits](http://song-of-github.herokuapp.com) has really nice algorithms to generate music out of simple 3D array of data. While this might not be obvious, it would be symbolic way to generate ambient sounds for the 'Landscape Canvas'

2. Using audio reactive elements to control the 'Landscape Canvas'. Would the artist intent be easily comprehensible in such an interaction?
