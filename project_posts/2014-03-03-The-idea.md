# 2.  The Idea

_“There are a thousand thoughts lying within a man that he does not know till he takes up the pen to write.” ― William Makepeace Thackeray_

#### We met up finally at HackerspaceSG for a preliminary discussion and exchange of ideas.
#### We agreed on the main idea, with several extensions and sub-ideas to explore.
#### We agree that we would aim to release a prototype by 16 March. (2 weeks timeline)

##The project will be split into 2 components

### Emo Pad (Working Title)
- Allow users express themselves by picking a color
- Allows user to interact / play with their generated bird
- Gives a very intimate experience with the emotion
- Gives a feeling of loneliness as a bird trapped in the app
- Frees the bird by swipping Bird towards the Landscape

### Landscape Canvas (Working Title)
- View flocking behavior of user generated birds
- Displayed on a large panoramic display
