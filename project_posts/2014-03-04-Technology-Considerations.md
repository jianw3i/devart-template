# Inital Technology Considerations

From our knowledge, there are several mature frameworks for creative coding, which have also been more commonly use for digital installations. Such examples are processing, openframeworks, cinder.

However, we have decided to use Web as a platform. Here are some of our reasons.

### Familiarity
Web programming and JS have became my choice of development. Maybe not so for Chinmay, but he has been interested in the web wish to take this opportunity to sharpen his JS and Web Audio skills.

### Rapid Prototyping
HTML and Javascript allows us to rapidly experiment with stuff. Instead of compiling, hitting a refresh button, and web developer tools even allows changing some values on the fly.

### Cross Platform
"Write once, run anywhere" seems to apply more for JS in browsers these days. Such applications can run across multiple operating systems, and even mobile devices like iOS and android.

### Improve the Web
By picking the web, we hope to be able to push the perception of what we could do with web, especially of its use with digital installations.

We also know that there are currently gaps (for example lack for tools in certain areas), and hopefully we are helping bridge that gap.

### Other Google Technologies
I initally thought if we should explore other google technologies (such as Google Compute, Dart, Go etc.) since it was possibly a factor in the judging process. However, we decided later that we should just go ahead with our initial conviction to use technologies which makes sense the most to us. Not that we couldn't be bothered, but it wasn't the perfect time and place. That said, the ability to be able to create so much richness with the web platform is also a testimony of Google's effort in pushing the web forward.
