#Some closing thoughts.

Hello from Nepal. This period has been crazy, especially this trip itself (where electricity and internet is pretty limited), preparations and work leading before the trip, along with this entry.

I'd like to thank Chinmay, my partner for this project. Chinmay was first to agree working together despite his busy schedule. (There were others who would loved collabrating , unfortunately this competition rules allowed a maximum of a 2 per entry). Even in the short span of time with Chinmay, I had learn't much about accostics and audio programming.

I would also like to thank my colleague and friend [Jian Wei](http://madebyjw.com), for bouncing and validating my ideas. And to [mrdoob](http://mrdoob.com) who have always been my inspiration. To [thespite](https://twitter.com/thespite) for giving me some ideas on NPR.

I think there's much more I wished to do, but in my limitations haven't been able to accomplish. I'm glad though, to be able to be a part of this journey. I sincerly hope that this is a start rather than a end to many greater possibilies :)
