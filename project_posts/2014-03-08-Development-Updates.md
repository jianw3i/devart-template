## Josh Development logs

March 3 - Started playing with [xgui](http://oos.moxiecode.com/js_canvas/xgui/) for colors. This library seems pretty useful and promising although it does not seem to be popular. Ended up trying to add [touch handling fixes](https://github.com/oosmoxiecode/xgui.js/pull/5) in xgui to make it work on iOS.

March 4 - Create initial touch based color pickers.

March 5 - Experiment with swipe gestures

March 6 - Help [test bird synths](https://notthetup.github.com/birds).
