_"Josh, this looks like the things you do."_


That’s how [DevArt](https://devart.withgoogle.com/) was brought to my attention by colleagues and friends. While in recent years I grew an interest in creative coding, generative design and graphics, I had hesitations participating.

###Questions

Before I could begin, there were so many questions I had to answer myself.

_“what’s devart about?”_

_“what is art to me? what is it i love?”_

_“how does one produces with a brilliant creative idea?”_

_“what is a great idea? and where does one find inspirations?”_

_“what do I want to create?”_

_“do I have the time for this? (with a packed schedule at work this season and a hiking trip for half a month in March before the deadline)”_


###Start Exploring

So I thought long and hard about these questions. I wrote down some of my answers, even though they may not be completely satisfactory. Some questions lead to even more questions, which makes me wonder if I’m too philosophical at times.

Finally, I decided that I should stop thinking too much and start doing something. Perhaps through doing and exploring, there’s is more to be experienced and learned. And better answers I could give in later posts than if I were to do so now.
